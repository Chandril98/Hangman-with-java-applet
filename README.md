# Hangman-with-java-applet
This is an approach to build a simple Hangman game in java applet 


Main file "HangMan.java" is under progress . I have done only the design there 
"Test.java" is the working file right now . in this file idea was to get input from user and draw the Hangman figure stepwise .. there are four buttons till now,  each button is alloted to some body parts of the figure .

class files are auto generatd 

Though you can copy and run the html file or make your own . It is basically for appletviewer
